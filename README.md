## Caveats

- All of the above are to be understood as hints and suggestions—not rules. (With one exception: [The Immutable Law of Tennis](#immutable)). They are intended as a way to help the player get into the right mindset for hitting well—not as dogma nor as rigid instruction. For any given prompt, there may be multiple scenarios in which it does not hold, or for which they might be caveats. The main criteria for inclusion is whether or not an idea can prime the player to find an effective mentality in the moment.
