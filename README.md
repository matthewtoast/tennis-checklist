## General

<a name="immutable"></a>
- Keep your eye on the ball.

## Mindset

- Be relaxed, but not nonchalant.
- Play the ball.
- Think about what you _want_, not what you don't want.
- Stay loose.
- Feel nothing.
    - You're not trying to impress anyone.
- It's just you and the ball.

## Footwork

- Move your feet. All the time.
- Lots of little steps.
- Stay on your toes. Avoid flat-footedness.

## Serve

- Clear your mind.
- Follow the same ritual, the exact same way, every time.
- Decide on type of serve—and don't change your mind.
- Focus on execution (trajectory to target zone) not outcome (e.g. forcing an error).
    - Focus on angle, direction, height over net, spin, and pace.
- Make sure you take enough time.
    - Don't rush.
    - Try: Take a deep breath.
    - Try: Count to 5.
- Don't futz with your grip.
    - Grip is insignificant compared to seeing the ball.
- Serve decisively.
- "Throw" the racket.
- You don't need to swing hard. Think natural but decisive.
- Don't drop your head!
- Is your arm extending fully?
- Are your shoulders slanted enough?
- Did you reach trophy pose quickly enough?
- Did you really _see_ the ball before you swung?
- Can you _see_ the racket pass through the ball?
- Did your body rotate?
- Did you fully commit?
- Did you fully release?
- Shoulder-based swing. Not elbow.
- "Elbow the enemy."
- Did you pull the racket all the way back?
- Was the racket head "up" soon enough?

### Ball toss

- Did you toss the ball high enough?
- Did you toss the ball out in front tenough?
- Did your toss arm really extend?
- Try breathing out as you toss.
- Try tossing a bit slower, smoother.

### First serve

### Second serve

- Accept missing the first serve, then put it behind you. Don't dwell on it.
- Focus on brushing up on the ball to pull it down into the opposing court.

### Flat serve

### Slice serve

### Kick serve

## Groundstrokes

- Ready stance.
- Move your feet.
- Bend your knees.
- Stay in the toaster.
- Step in.
- Brush the ball from 6 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
- Throw the racket.

### Forehand

- Finish with racket slung over shoulder.
- Your non-dominant arm should:
    - Hold the ball at bay.
    - Keep you stady and counterbalance your swing.

### Backhand (single-handed)

### Backhand slice

## Volley

- Athletic stance. Knees bent. Leaning forward.
- Think "hungry hungry hippo." Go after it.
- Be moving forward.
- Track the ball like a cyborg.
- Don't wince.

### Punch volley

- Think boxing. Hands out in front.
- You should be able to see the back of the strings.
- Your head should follow the racket.
- Try: "Strike a pose." Freeze just after contact.
- Try: Your body's momentum gives it force.
- Try: Step at contact.

### Swing volley

- Be stepping toward your target.

## Smash

- When you see a high lob, think "This is my favorite shot. I can't wait to smash this."
- Send a message: "I won't let you lob me without consequences."
- Get behind the ball. (Or: Keep the ball in front of you.)
- Keep moving your feet until _just before_ you strike. Don't settle too soon.
- Don't drop your head! See it all the way down.
- Fully commit. Full swing, body rotation, and release.

## Caveats

- All of the above are to be understood as hints and suggestions—not rules. (With one exception: [The Immutable Law of Tennis](#immutable)). They are intended as a way to help the player get into the right mindset for hitting well—not as dogma nor as rigid instruction. For any given prompt, there may be multiple scenarios in which it does not hold, or for which they might be caveats. The main criteria for inclusion is whether or not an idea can prime the player to find an effective mentality in the moment.
